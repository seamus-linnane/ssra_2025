# SSRA 2025 Utilities

This repository contains a series of interrelated but standalone projects developed for the Beacon Hospital Summer School for Research in AI 2025.
Each notebook inside `notebooks/` is a self-contained utility with its own README and requirements.
This years projects have their own folders inside `projects/`. 

A yaml file to describe the specific env used to develop these projects is presented in  `environment.yaml`
