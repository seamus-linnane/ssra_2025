# SSRA 2025 Utilities

This repository contains a series of interrelated but standalone projects developed for the Beacon Hospital Summer School for Research in AI 2025.
Each folder inside `projects/` is a self-contained utility with its own README and requirements.

A yaml file to describe the specific env used to develop these projects is presented in  `environment.yaml`
